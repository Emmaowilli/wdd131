            <img src="images/profile01.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
            <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Owilli and I am from Kampala, Uganda. I enjoy watching movies and 
                listening to music. I also like playing football. I am a return missionary, having served in the Zimbabwe Bulawayo mission. 
                During my mission, I saw my faith in Jesus grow more than at any other time in my life. 
                I am still single, but I have hope that soon I will get married and be sealed in the temple with my eternal companion.</p>

                <p>The Uganda Equator is one of the most famous landmarks in Uganda. It is an imaginary line that 
                    divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The equator passes through Uganda, 
                    and there are special spots where visitors can stand in both hemispheres at the same time. Many tourists
                    visit these sites to take pictures and see interesting demonstrations about how water swirls differently in each hemisphere. 
                    The Uganda Equator is a great place to learn about geography and enjoy a unique travel experience.</p>
