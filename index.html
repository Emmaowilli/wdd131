            <p>The Uganda Equator is one of the most famous landmarks in Uganda. It is an imaginary line that 
                divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The equator passes through Uganda, 
                and there are special spots where visitors can stand in both hemispheres at the same time. Many tourists
                 visit these sites to take pictures and see interesting demonstrations about how water swirls differently in each hemisphere. 
                The Uganda Equator is a great place to learn about geography and enjoy a unique travel experience.</p>
